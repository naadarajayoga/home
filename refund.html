    <p>At Naada Raja Yoga, we aim to keep things clear and fair for everyone. Generally, all purchases are non-refundable. However, we understand that exceptional circumstances can arise on your end as well. If a unique situation comes up, we’re open to considering exceptions on a case-by-case basis. If we ever need to cancel a session and can’t provide an alternative, we’ll do our best to find a fair solution together.</p>

    <h3 style="font-size:1.15rem;margin-top:22px;margin-bottom:7px;color:#008080;font-weight:600;">Timeframe Flexibility</h3>
    <p style="font-size:1rem;margin-bottom:8px;line-height:1.7;">For your convenience, we offer a bit of flexibility in completing your sessions. For example, a 5-day session can be completed within 7 days. This flexibility will be shown right before you purchase, so you know the timeframe. The reason is that our teachers reserve specific time slots for you in advance, and they plan their schedules around these sessions. This means that if a session is scheduled from 6 to 7 a.m. and you arrive late, the session will still end at the planned time, as the teacher's availability is arranged ahead of time.</p>

    <h3 style="font-size:1.15rem;margin-top:22px;margin-bottom:7px;color:#008080;font-weight:600;">Responsibility of Participants</h3>
    <p style="font-size:1rem;margin-bottom:8px;line-height:1.7;">Please just make sure you can attend the classes you sign up for, and have the right internet connection and equipment ready for online sessions. This way, everything runs smoothly for everyone!</p>
